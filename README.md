# Project Discreption
The IEEE 802.11a Wireless LAN standard which operates in the 5 GHz unlicensed band occupying a 20 MHz
bandwidth is based on OFDM. The main goal of the project is to implement the OFDM system specified in the
802.11a standard. This document will serve as a guide to the implementation, and will also study the OFDM
design and discuss some of the design choices.
